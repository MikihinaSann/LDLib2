# LDLib2 UI Test Harness

Automated UI tests that run in a **real client**. One command launches the game, creates a world,
opens UIs, clicks and types, waits for server round trips, asserts, screenshots, and exits with a
non-zero code if anything failed.

```
gradlew runClient -PldTest=all
  -> build/ldlib2-uitest/report.json     machine-readable results
  -> build/ldlib2-uitest/report.txt      human summary
  -> build/ldlib2-uitest/screenshots/    full frames + per-element crops
```

Nothing is human-in-the-loop, and nothing is mocked: input goes through the real
`Screen` → `ModularUIWidget` → `UIEventDispatcher` path, and machine UIs open through the real
right-click → menu → S2C packet path.

---

## Status

Not everything here carries the same confidence. Worth knowing before you rely on a step:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Proven by real runs** | opening UIs, selector resolution, transform-correct bounds, hover/click/key/type/focus, the hit-test guard, full-frame and per-element screenshots, the report, failure path, exit codes, Gradle wiring, world bootstrap, scenario isolation, watchdog, background runs (window never focused, physical pointer never moved), headless runs (no window shown, no monitor attached, triggered over SSH) |
| **Written, not yet exercised** | `server(...)` and everything server-side (`useBlock`, `waitForSync`, `waitUntilServer`, `setBlock`, `withBlockEntity`, …), `drag`, `scroll`, `doubleClick`, `shiftClick`, `typeInto`, most `ElementQuery` filters, `/ldlib2_autotest` |
| **Not built** | UI-tree JSON snapshots + baseline diff, golden-image diff, JUnit XML |

The middle row is the gap that matters: the code compiles and reads correctly but no scenario has
run it end to end. Closing it means writing a machine-UI scenario and a sync scenario against
`TestBlockEntity` — the worked example below is written against exactly that.

## Writing a scenario

Put it in `src/main/java` (not `src/test` — that source set has no Minecraft on the classpath) and
register it with an annotation. Discovery is an annotation scan across every loaded mod, so a mod
that depends on LDLib2 needs **no changes on the LDLib2 side**.

```java
@LDLRegisterClient(name = "furnace_ui", group = "mymod", registry = UIScenario.REGISTRY,
                   environment = RegistrationEnvironment.DEV_ONLY)
public class FurnaceUiScenario implements UIScenario {

    private static final BlockPos POS = new BlockPos(8, 65, 8);

    @Override
    public void configure(ScenarioOptions o) {
        o.tags("machine").guiScale(3);
    }

    @Override
    public void define(ScenarioBuilder s) {
        s.clearArea(POS, 2)
         .setBlock(POS, MyBlocks.FURNACE.get())
         .withBlockEntity(POS, FurnaceBlockEntity.class, be -> be.setFuel(100))
         .awaitClientBlockEntity(POS)
         .useBlock(POS)                                    // real right-click on the server
         .awaitScreen(ModularUIContainerScreen.class)
         .awaitModularUI()
         .click("#btn_start")
         .waitForSync("burn time reaches the client",
                 sc  -> sc.blockEntity(POS, FurnaceBlockEntity.class).getBurnTime(),
                 ctx -> ctx.clientBlockEntity(POS, FurnaceBlockEntity.class).getBurnTime())
         .checkTextContains("#status_label", "Burning")
         .screenshot("running")
         .teardown("close", ctx -> ctx.requirePlayer().closeContainer());
    }
}
```

`RegistrationEnvironment.DEV_ONLY` keeps scenarios out of production builds.

## Running

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `gradlew runClient -PldTest=all` | every registered scenario |
| `-PldTest=furnace_ui` | one by name |
| `-PldTest=a,b,c` | several |
| `-PldTest=group:mymod` | by `@LDLRegisterClient(group=...)` |
| `-PldTest=tag:fast` | by `ScenarioOptions#tags` |
| `-PldTest=regex:.*_ui` | by pattern |
| `-PldTestExclude=slow_one` | subtract from the selection |
| `-PldTestKeepOpen` | leave the game running afterwards |
| `-PldTestWindow=1280x720` | pin the window (default: maximise; 1920x1080 when headless) |
| `-PldTestGuiScale=3` | run-wide GUI scale (default 2; scenarios can override) |
| `-PldTestInputMode=REAL` | drive the real OS cursor instead of the logical one (**foreground only**) |
| `-PldTestHeadless` | no visible window; works with no monitor attached (see [Headless runs](#headless-runs)) |

`verifyUiTest` is attached to `runClient` with `finalizedBy`, so it runs even if the client crashes,
and **a missing report is itself a failure**.

### Background runs

A run does not need the window focused and never touches your mouse, so you can start one and carry
on working on the same machine.

Input goes straight to `Screen#mouseClicked` and friends, so it never depended on the window manager.
What did was the *pointer*: `ModularUI` recomputes the hovered element every frame from the `mouseX`
/ `mouseY` that `Screen#render` receives, and vanilla derives those from `MouseHandler#xpos()/ypos()`
— the physical cursor. That position now comes from `CursorState`, which a mixin on those two getters
answers with, so hover, tooltips, the carried item and `AbstractContainerScreen`'s hovered slot all
follow the synthetic cursor while the real one stays where you left it. `Minecraft#setScreen(null)`
would normally capture and hide the pointer through `MouseHandler#grabMouse`; that is cancelled for
as long as a virtual cursor is installed. Captures read the main framebuffer, so they are unaffected
by focus or occlusion.

Two things are worth knowing:

- **The window takes focus once, at launch.** It is created by FML's early-loading window, before any
  mod code exists, so nothing here can prevent that. After the run arms itself, nothing raises or
  focuses it again — including the real OS windows the floating-view scenarios open.
- **OS-delivered input is dropped while a run is active.** Vanilla has no focus guard on
  `MouseHandler#onPress` or `KeyboardHandler#keyPress`, so a stray click on the *unfocused* game
  window really does reach the game and lands in the middle of a run. `RawInputGate` closes that for
  the duration; while it is up, the ways to interrupt a run are the window's close button, the
  watchdog, or killing Gradle.

`-PldTestInputMode=REAL` is the one exception and is foreground-only by definition: it warps the real
cursor and waits for the OS to deliver the event, so it focuses the window and moves your mouse.

### Headless runs

`-PldTestHeadless` goes one step further than a background run: no window is ever shown, and the
machine does not need a monitor at all. A run triggered over SSH, on a box with the display unplugged
and nobody logged in at the console, produces the same report and the same screenshots.

It is opt-in and leaves nothing behind. Without the flag every code path is the one that was there
before — the window is maximised and shown exactly as it used to be, so a run you want to *watch*
still behaves like one.

```
gradlew runClient  -PldTest=all   -PldTestHeadless
gradlew runParTest -PldTest=all   -PldTestJobs=4 -PldTestHeadless
gradlew runMpTest  -PldMpTest=all -PldTestHeadless
```

The parallel and multi-process harnesses need it passed explicitly like this, and their orchestrators
forward it to the builds they spawn: a child build is a fresh Gradle invocation and inherits none of
the parent's project properties.

Almost nothing had to change, because the harness never depended on a visible window in the first
place: captures download the main render target's colour texture rather than reading the swap chain,
and `SYNTHETIC` input dispatches straight into `Screen`. What the flag actually does is stop the
runner asking the window system for things a display-less machine cannot answer:

- **The window is hidden** (`glfwHideWindow`) instead of maximised, and a size is pinned instead of
  being read off the monitor — see [Resolution](#resolution) below.
- **FML's early loading window is disabled.** It calls `glfwGetPrimaryMonitor` and treats `NULL` as
  fatal, so it dies long before Minecraft is reached — behind a modal dialog nobody is there to
  dismiss, so the run *hangs* rather than fails. Minecraft's own `Window` handles a null monitor
  fine. NeoForge moved this setting into `FMLConfig`, which has no system-property override, so the
  Gradle wiring writes `earlyWindowControl = false` into the run directory's `config/fml.toml` for
  the duration of the run. That file is shared with ordinary interactive runs, so
  `ldlib2RestoreEarlyWindow` — a finalizer, and therefore one that runs even when the client crashes
  — puts back exactly what this build turned off. Kill Gradle itself and the restore is missed; it is
  idempotent, so the cost is one later `runClient` without its loading window.
- **Vsync is off.** The runner advances one step per rendered frame, so the frame rate is the clock
  the whole run keeps, and what a hidden window's swap interval does is a driver decision.
- **`-PldTestInputMode=REAL` is rejected**, not downgraded, and rejected at Gradle configuration time
  so it costs nothing. Real input needs a focusable window; accepting it here would let a run pass
  while testing nothing.

The bullet above about the window taking focus once at launch does not apply — with the early window
gone, nothing is ever shown or focused.

#### Resolution

Two numbers, and confusing them is the usual mistake:

| | value | set by |
|---|---|---|
| **Framebuffer** — the pixel size of every screenshot | e.g. 3840x2160 | `-PldTestWindow=WxH` |
| **Logical viewport** — the coordinate space the UI lays out in | 1920x1080 | framebuffer ÷ GUI scale |

```
-PldTestWindow given       -> that size, headless or not
omitted, headless          -> 1920x1080
omitted, not headless      -> maximise / fill the monitor work area (unchanged)
```

The headless default exists because maximising reads the primary monitor's work area and there may be
no primary monitor. A malformed `WxH` falls back to it rather than aborting the run.

- **A hidden window is not clamped to the desktop.** `-PldTestWindow=3840x2160` really does produce
  3840x2160 PNGs on a machine with *no monitor at all* — verified, not assumed. The ceiling is
  `GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE` (Minecraft calls `glfwSetWindowSizeLimits` with it), not any display.
- **Raising the resolution alone enlarges the layout, it does not sharpen it.** 4K at GUI scale 2
  gives the UI a 1920x1080 logical viewport — a different layout from 1080p at scale 2, not a
  crisper picture of the same one. For "same layout, more pixels" scale both:
  `-PldTestWindow=3840x2160 -PldTestGuiScale=4`.
- **Never let the GUI scale go auto.** Auto picks the largest scale the window supports, which on a
  4K frame is 8 — a 480x257 viewport that collapses any full-screen UI. `-PldTestGuiScale` defaults
  to 2 for exactly this reason; individual scenarios raise it via `ScenarioOptions#guiScale`.
- **Pass `-PldTestWindow` explicitly whenever captures are compared between machines.** Left out, the
  size is 1920x1080 headless but "whatever this monitor's work area is" otherwise, so the two do not
  line up.
- 4K costs time and memory: one RGBA frame is 32 MB and the readback is a synchronous GPU stall, so
  capture-heavy scenarios slow down measurably (`snake_hud` went 2261 ms → 2755 ms).

#### When it is not the harness

None of this touches the graphics stack below GLFW. A headless run still needs a real GPU OpenGL 3.2
core context, and on Windows the ICD is bound to a display device: RDP replaces the console session's
display driver, and some drivers fall back to GDI Generic (OpenGL 1.1) with nothing attached, which
Minecraft cannot start on.

Check `GL_RENDERER` before blaming the harness. A dozen lines of LWJGL — `glfwInit`, Minecraft's own
window hints, `glfwCreateWindow`, `GL.createCapabilities`, print `GL_RENDERER` — answers it in
seconds, where a failing `runClient` takes minutes. Two things that probe should also tell you:

- **Read back from an FBO, not the default framebuffer.** A hidden window's default framebuffer reads
  back black, which is why captures go through the main render target. A probe that only checks the
  default framebuffer will report failure on a machine that works fine.
- `glfwGetPrimaryMonitor() == 0` and `glfwGetMonitors() == null` are **not** by themselves a problem.
  On an NVIDIA + Windows 11 box in session 0 with zero monitors enumerated, a real 3.2 core context
  comes back and the whole suite passes.

If the context really is GDI Generic, a virtual display driver or an HDMI dummy plug fixes it and
needs no code change here.

### Iterating

A cold run spends most of its wall clock on Gradle, mod loading and world creation — none of which
changes between attempts. While working on a scenario:

```
gradlew runClient -PldTest=my_scenario -PldTestKeepOpen
# then, in the running game, as many times as you like:
/ldlib2_autotest run my_scenario
/ldlib2_autotest list
```

## The API

Every builder method returns the builder. The whole vocabulary is convenience over three primitives,
so anything the named steps do not cover is one lambda away:

```java
s.step("anything on the client thread", ctx -> { ... })   // TestContext
 .server("anything on the server thread", sc -> { ... })  // ServerContext, submitted and awaited
 .waitUntil("any condition", ctx -> ...)                  // the single waiting mechanism
```

**World / server** — `setBlock` `fill` `clearArea` `withBlockEntity` `teleportPlayer` `setGameMode`
`giveItem` `setHeldItem` `runCommand` `serverTicks` `awaitClientChunk` `awaitClientBlockEntity`

**Open UI** — `openScreenTest` `openScreen` `openModularUI` `useBlock` `awaitScreen`
`awaitModularUI` `awaitElement` `closeScreen`

**Input** — `hover` `click` `rightClick` `middleClick` `shiftClick` `doubleClick` `clickAt` `scroll`
`drag` `dragTo` `focus` `blur` `key` `keyDown` `keyUp` `type` `typeInto`

**Wait / sync** — `frames` `ticks` `waitMs` `waitUntil` `waitUntilServer` `waitForText`
`waitForTextContains` **`waitForSync`**

**Assert** — `check` `checkServer` `checkEquals` `checkExists` `checkNotExists` `checkCount`
`checkText` `checkTextContains` `checkVisible` `checkHidden` `checkFocused` `checkHovered`
`checkClass` `checkBounds` `checkScreen` `checkValue`

**Capture** — `screenshot` `screenshotElement` `screenshotSurface`

**Structure** — `group` `repeat` `teardown` `teardownServer` `settleMs` `timeoutMs` `log`

### Targeting

Selectors go through LDLib2's own CSS engine: `tag`, `.class`, `#id`, `*`, descendant, `>`,
`:not(...)`, and state pseudo-classes (`:hover` → `.__hovered__`).

Selector **lists (`,`), attribute selectors (`[...]`) and `:nth-child` are rejected with an error**,
because the matcher silently mis-parses them rather than failing. Use `ctx.query(...)` instead:

```java
ctx.query("button").withText("+").excludeInternal().nth(1).one();
```

Every input step hit-tests the target's centre before acting, and fails with
`"resolved X but hit test returned Y"` if the element is occluded, clipped or off screen — so a test
can never silently click nothing and pass.

### A UI in its own OS window

`ctx.el`, `ctx.query` and every input step resolve through the UI behind `Minecraft#screen`. A UI
hosted in a `ModularUIWindow` is behind no screen at all: it takes its input from raw GLFW callbacks
on its own window and is drawn into an off-screen target that never reaches the game's frame. Three
things address that, and each is the only way to do its job:

```java
ctx.in(window.getModularUI(), "button")   // query that window's UI instead of the screen's
   .withText("Save").one();

ctx.input(window)                         // post into the window's own event queue
   .moveTo(element).mouseDown(MOUSE_LEFT);

s.screenshotSurface("label", ctx -> window.surface());   // read back the window's own framebuffer
```

`ctx.input(window)` posts real `OsWindowEvent`s, so the drain, the hit test, the move/resize gesture
check and the dispatch are all the window's own — not a shortcut around them. Coordinates are that
window's GUI space, which is what `ElementBounds` already reports for elements in its UI. Post one
primitive per step, exactly as with the screen driver: the queue is drained once per frame, so
anything that needs a frame to pass in between — a drag — will not start if you batch it.

Two things about it that are load-bearing rather than incidental:

- **One driver per window, kept for the whole scenario.** It remembers where `moveTo` last aimed and
  re-states that position with every button event. A window reads its *own* cached cursor when a
  button arrives, and the platform writes that cache too — so without the re-aim, a physical mouse
  drifting over the window between the aim and the press takes the synthetic click with it.
- **Press and release in the same step for a control that tears down its host** — a window's close
  button, or the debugger's window toggle. LDLib2 controls fire on MOUSE_DOWN, so by the next step
  there is no window left to release into.

## What gets verified

1. **Assertions** — `check(desc, cond)` records expected/actual; a failure marks the step failed and
   the scenario keeps going, so one run surfaces several problems.
2. **Screenshots** — full frames plus per-element crops, taken on the frame *after* the step so they
   never show stale state. A flat-colour image is flagged `SUSPECT` (usually a wrong framebuffer).
   Failures capture automatically.
3. **`report.json`** — schema-versioned, atomically written, with per-step status, timings, target
   bounds, hit-test result, checks, capture paths, and the full environment including the loaded mod
   list.

## Gotchas the harness handles for you

- **Hover is resolved during rendering.** Mouse events on `ModularUIWidget` route to a cached hovered
  element, so a click in the same frame as a cursor move hits the *previous* target. The runner runs
  one step per rendered frame and refreshes the hover before every dispatch.
- **Drags are multi-frame by nature.** A drag only starts when the source sees `MOUSE_LEAVE` while a
  button is held. `drag(...)` expands into eight frame-separated steps and tells you if the drag
  never started.
- **Settle is wall-clock, never frames.** A dev world renders far faster than it ticks, and
  `ModularUI#tick` — which refreshes data-bound labels — runs at 20 Hz. Use `ticks(n)` or a condition
  wait for anything data-driven.
- **The pointer.** `glfwSetCursorPos` moves the pointer of whoever is at the machine, and GLFW ignores
  it outright while the window is unfocused — so a harness built on it can only run in the foreground
  of an idle machine. `CursorState` is the seam that replaces it, the sibling of `KeyState` and there
  for the same reason.
- **Modifier keys.** `glfwGetKey` reads the physical keyboard and nothing in-process can move it, so
  `KeyState` is overridden for the duration of a run. `key(k, MOD_CONTROL)` therefore holds control
  as a real key rather than only setting the event's modifier mask — `UIEvent#isCtrlDown()` reads
  held state, so a mask alone would make ctrl+A behave like a bare A.
- **Stale worlds.** Each run gets a uniquely named world and sweeps `saves/ldtest_*` first — a leaked
  session lock breaks the *next* run, which is much harder to diagnose.

## Adopting it in your own mod

1. Depend on LDLib2 as usual.
2. Write scenarios in `src/main/java` with `@LDLRegisterClient(registry = UIScenario.REGISTRY)`.
3. Copy the `-PldTest` block and the `verifyUiTest` task from LDLib2's `build.gradle`
   (search for `ldlib2.uitest`), or `apply from:` `gradle/ldlib2-uitest.gradle`.
4. `gradlew runClient -PldTest=group:<yourmod>`.

# Multi-process tests (dedicated server + N clients)

Everything above runs one client against its integrated server. The multi-process harness tests the
**full wire**: one real dedicated server plus one client per role, connected over localhost, driven
in lockstep. This is how you test what a *second* player sees — `@DescSynced` world sync, per-player
UI sessions, C2S interaction packets, RPC — against the same code paths production runs.

```
gradlew runMpTest -PldMpTest=mp_sync_smoke
  -> build/ldlib2-mptest/report.json      merged, machine-readable
  -> build/ldlib2-mptest/report.txt       human summary
  -> build/ldlib2-mptest/server/          the dedicated server's own report + gradle.log
  -> build/ldlib2-mptest/clientA|B/       each client's report, log and screenshots
```

One command spawns `runMpServer` + `runMpClientA`/`runMpClientB` as child Gradle builds, prepares
`runs/mpServer` (fresh flat world, offline mode, a free port), coordinates everything over a local
TCP hub, merges the three reports, and fails the build via `verifyMpTest` if anything failed —
a missing report included. A dying orchestrator can never leak game processes: every process treats
a dropped hub connection as "shut down now".

## Writing a multi-process scenario

A scenario is an ordered list of **segments**. Each segment is owned by one side; everyone else
waits at a barrier. Inside a `client(..)` block the entire `ScenarioBuilder` DSL above is available
unchanged.

```java
@LDLRegister(name = "my_sync", group = "mymod", registry = MPScenario.REGISTRY,
             environment = RegistrationEnvironment.DEV_ONLY)   // plain @LDLRegister - both dists discover it
public class MySyncScenario implements MPScenario {
    public void configure(MPScenarioOptions o) { o.clients("A", "B"); }

    public void define(MPScenarioBuilder s) {
        s.server("place machine", sc -> { ... })               // dedicated server thread
         .client("A", "open ui and click", b -> b              // ordinary ScenarioBuilder steps
                 .useBlock(POS)                                // real C2S use packet in MP mode
                 .awaitScreen(ModularUIContainerScreen.class)
                 .click("#btn").screenshot("clicked"))
         .serverWaitUntil("server saw it", sc -> ...)          // re-checked every tick
         .server("assert authoritative state", sc -> sc.check(...))
         .client("B", "other client sees it", b -> b
                 .useBlock(POS).waitForText("#label", "43"))
         .sync("value converged on B", "B",                    // cross-process waitForSync
                 sc  -> sc.blockEntity(POS, MyBE.class).getValue(),
                 ctx -> ctx.clientBlockEntity(POS, MyBE.class).getValue())
         .allClients("close", b -> b.closeScreen())            // every client, barrier waits for all
         .teardownServer("clean", sc -> { ... });              // teardown = owned-only, no barriers
    }
}
```

Segment vocabulary: `server` (one task), `serverWaitUntil` (per-tick poll), `client(role, block)`,
`allClients(block)`, `sync`/`syncAll` (client polls until its value equals the server's, fetched as
a probe over the control channel and compared by Gson JSON form — keep values to primitives/strings),
`fetch`/`fetchOn` (below), `teardownServer`/`teardownClient`/`teardownAllClients`.

### Asserting with a tolerance: `fetch`

`sync` compares by JSON equality, which is right for a synced integer and useless for anything
continuous — two processes whose body angles differ by a twentieth of a degree agree about
everything that matters, and no rounding makes a live float converge on the nose. `fetch` copies
the server's number into every client's scratch state once, and leaves the comparison to the client:

```java
.fetch("server.yaw", "the body angle the server holds", Double.class,
        sc -> (double) mover(sc).yaw())
.client("B", "and this client agrees", b -> b.check("within a tick of turning", ctx -> {
    double server = ctx.get("server.yaw");
    double here   = moverOf(ctx, "LDTestA").yaw();
    ctx.log("server " + server + ", here " + here);        // in the report either way
    return Math.abs(Mth.wrapDegrees(server - here)) < 2.0;
}))
```

The reading is taken when the segment runs, so put the `fetch` where you want the sample taken —
what a later step compares against is the server at a known point in the scenario, not at whenever
that step happened to fire. `fetchOn(role, ...)` restricts it to one client. Use `Double.class`
for anything numeric: Gson reads a bare JSON number as a double.

Semantics worth knowing:

- **Soft check failures do not gate other processes** — `check(..)` marks the step failed and the
  run FAIL, exactly like solo. Only a *thrown* step (or a timeout) aborts: the owner broadcasts its
  unfinished segments as ABORTED, every other process's barrier throws, and everyone converges on
  its own teardown, then the next scenario.
- **`server(..)` helpers inside client blocks throw.** A multi-process client has no integrated
  server; world mutation belongs in `s.server(..)` segments, cross-process waits in `s.sync(..)`.
  `useBlock` is the exception — in MP mode it switches to the real client-side interaction path.
- **`ServerContext.player(role)`** resolves a role's player on the dedicated server
  (usernames are `LDTest<role>`); `players()` gives all of them.
- **`define()` runs in every process and must be deterministic** — same segments, same order,
  everywhere. Never branch on live state in `define`; segment bodies are where that happens.
- **A client skips scenarios it has no role in, but its next scenario's clock starts immediately** —
  while the others are still on the earlier scenario, it sits in its first barrier. When scenarios
  with different `clients(..)` sets share a run, size `scenarioTimeoutMs` to cover the scenarios a
  non-participant waits through.

## The dist rule (the one way to break the harness)

`define()` also runs in the **dedicated-server process**, so the scenario class must stay loadable
there. Method *signatures* resolve when a class links; bodies are lazy. In practice:

- Fine: `Consumer<ServerContext>`, `Consumer<ScenarioBuilder>` blocks, inner `ctx -> ...` steps,
  `Predicate<TestContext>`, sync getters returning boxed values, class literals like
  `awaitScreen(Foo.class)` (resolved only when the owning client expands the block).
- **Not fine**: a lambda whose erased signature names a client-only type — e.g.
  `Function<TestContext, Screen>` factories (`openScreen`), or a lambda capturing a client-typed
  local. Use `openScreenTest(name)` or move the code into an `@OnlyIn(Dist.CLIENT)` helper class
  referenced only inside step bodies.

`MPScenarioDistLoadingTest` (a game test, so it runs in every `runGameTestServer`) instantiates and
defines every registered MP scenario on the dedicated dist — a violation fails there with the
scenario's name instead of crashing a live `runMpTest`.

## Running

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `gradlew runMpTest` | every registered MP scenario (`-PldMpTest=all`) |
| `-PldMpTest=<name\|a,b\|group:x\|tag:y\|regex:p>` | the same selection grammar as `-PldTest` |
| `-PldMpClients=A,B` | which client processes to launch (default `A,B`; scenarios needing absent roles are skipped) |

A cold run takes ~1–2 minutes: three child Gradle builds boot in parallel, clients join over
localhost, scenarios run in lockstep, reports merge. Timings inside client blocks are the solo
defaults; barriers use the scenario budget (`MPScenarioOptions#scenarioTimeoutMs`, default 5 min)
because they legitimately span another process's whole segment.

Debugging order when a run fails: `build/ldlib2-mptest/report.txt` (which role, which segment),
then that role's `report.json` and screenshots, then its `gradle.log`. The orchestrator's own
`[mptest]` lines in the build output show the hub's view: who connected, who joined, which
scenario ended how, who exited with what.

## Where the multi-process code lives

| Piece | Location |
|---|---|
| public API (`MPScenario`, `MPScenarioBuilder`, `MPScenarioOptions`, `MPSegment`) | `com.lowdragmc.lowdraglib2.uitest.mp` |
| control protocol + hub client + orchestrator (no Minecraft imports) | `...uitest.mp` (`MPMessages`, `MPHubClient`, `MPTestOrchestrator`) |
| client-side compiler/session glue | `com.lowdragmc.lowdraglib2.uitest.MPClientSession` |
| dedicated-server runner + bootstrap | `...uitest.MPServerRunner`, `...uitest.MPServerBootstrap` |
| Gradle wiring (`runMpTest`, `verifyMpTest`, the three child runs) | `gradle/ldlib2-mptest.gradle` |
| LDLib2's own MP scenarios | `com.lowdragmc.lowdraglib2.test.uitest.mp` |

Adopting it downstream mirrors the solo harness: write `MPScenario`s in `src/main/java`, copy
`gradle/ldlib2-mptest.gradle` next to your `runs { }` block, and run
`gradlew runMpTest -PldMpTest=group:<yourmod>`.

## Where the code lives

| Package | Contents |
|---|---|
| `com.lowdragmc.lowdraglib2.uitest` | public API + engine: `UIScenario`, `ScenarioBuilder`, `TestContext`, `ServerContext`, `UITestRunner` |
| `...uitest.input` | `InputDriver`, synthetic/real drivers, `Keys`, `WindowInput` (a UI in its own OS window) |
| `...uitest.target` | selector validation, stable element paths, text extraction |
| `...uitest.capture` | framebuffer readback and cropping |
| `...uitest.report` | report model and writer |
| `com.lowdragmc.lowdraglib2.gui.ui.utils` | the seams a run installs itself into: `KeyState`, `CursorState`, `RawInputGate` |
| `com.lowdragmc.lowdraglib2.test.uitest` | LDLib2's own scenarios (dev only) |
