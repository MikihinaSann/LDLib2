/**
 * Turns key presses inside an editor into {@link EditorAction}s.
 *
 * <p>Listens on the editor element in the <b>bubble</b> phase, which is what keeps the keymap out of the
 * way of everything below it: an element that consumed the key — a text field typing a character, a
 * dialog closing on Escape — has already stopped the event, and the keymap never sees it. The cost is
 * that a shortcut cannot override a focused control, which is the right way round.
 *
 * <p>Modifiers are read from {@link KeyState} rather than the event's {@code modifiers} field: that is
 * where macOS's command key is mapped onto control, where a UI hosted in its own OS window reads its own
 * keyboard, and where the test harness injects synthetic modifiers.
